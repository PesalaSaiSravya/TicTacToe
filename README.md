# TicTacToe
"Built a Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java with both human and AI gameplay options. This project demonstrates my proficiency in Java, object-oriented programming, and implementing game mechanics like win conditions and move validation. A fun coding experience that strengthened my problem-solving skills!"

Key highlights of the project include:

Object-Oriented Design: The game is structured using classes for core functionality. Game class handles the game board setup, win/draw conditions, and move placement. Player is an abstract class extended by HumanPlayer and AIPlayer to implement player-specific behavior.

AI Implementation: The AIPlayer class uses random move generation to simulate a basic AI opponent, ensuring valid moves are made without repeating positions.

Dynamic Game Flow: The game alternates turns between players, checks for win conditions (rows, columns, diagonals), and ends when a player wins or the game is a draw.

Robust Validation: Player inputs are validated to ensure moves are made within valid bounds and to avoid overwriting existing moves.

This project enhanced my knowledge of Java, object-oriented principles, and game logic implementation. It also strengthened my skills in designing user interactions and handling AI-based decision-making.
